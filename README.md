- **[AI Time Series Framework](https://github.com/rhshriva/AI_Time_Series)** - ML-powered forecasting and anomaly detection using deep learning models (LSTM, Transformers) for temporal data analysis.

## Work Experience
**Engineering Manager @ GEICO Tech (_Nov 2024 - Present_)**
- Leading multi-cloud Kubernetes orchestration across bare metal, Azure, and AWS infrastructures with comprehensive observability frameworks, chaos engineering practices, and automated tooling pipelines to ensure resilient, production-grade deployments at scale.

**Engineering Manager @ AWS (_Oct 2019 - _Nov 2024)**
- Distributed Systems Architecture: Architected multi-petabyte distributed database systems with advanced heat management algorithms and resource partitioning strategies. Designed high-throughput data processing pipelines capable of handling massive table partitions across heterogeneous compute clusters.
- Test Engineering & Validation Frameworks: Developed comprehensive testing harnesses for parallel query execution engines and distributed transaction processing systems. Implemented automated validation pipelines using property-based testing and fault injection methodologies to ensure correctness at scale.
- Telemetry & Observability Infrastructure: Built real-time streaming telemetry systems using event-driven serverless architectures with Kinesis, Lambda, and CloudWatch integration. Designed low-latency metric aggregation pipelines for monitoring distributed ML training jobs and compute workload performance analytics.
- Fault Detection & Automated Remediation: Engineered GPU health monitoring systems with statistical anomaly detection algorithms and predictive failure analysis. Implemented dynamic cluster management with automated node eviction and workload redistribution, achieving 20% failure reduction and $20M cost optimization.
- Technical Leadership & System Design: Led architecture reviews, technical design sessions, and cross-team integration efforts for large-scale distributed systems. Mentored engineers on advanced topics including distributed consensus algorithms, performance optimization techniques, and reliability engineering practices.

**Principal Engineer, Apple Inc.** *Sunnyvale, CA, 2018-2019*
- Data Validation System for Apple Logs:** Led the development of a data validation system to ensure the integrity of log data from Apple devices and Map services. Implemented a rules engine and validator modules for deeply nested protobuf 2.5 data, enabling parsing and analysis of complex hierarchical log formats at scale. The system provided oversight into the accuracy of multi-terabyte volumes of machine-generated logs.
- Distributed Rate Limiter for Apple Maps:** Designed and implemented a distributed rate limiter for throttling and traffic shaping across Apple Maps services. Led a scrum team, leveraging technologies like gRPC, Zookeeper, and Netty. The rate limiter handled up to 14K transactions per second per node with ~10ms latency, providing control over API quotas and preventing SLA breaches.

**Principal Member of Technical Staff, Salesforce.com** *San Francisco, January 2016 - February 2018*
- Developed a software load balancer for Apache Phoenix Query Server (PQS) that enabled intelligent routing and horizontal scaling. The load balancer fetched server availability and metadata from Zookeeper to direct client queries based on real-time load data. This allowed dynamic scaling of PQS instances to handle increasing query workloads.

**Principal HDFS Engineer, BlueTalon** *Redwood City, January 2015 - January 2016*
- Developed a scalable audit capability for HDFS such that all commands related to files/folders could be audited. The audit was logged in Kafka, which was further processed by downstream systems. Java code injection was utilized to inject code in HDFS (Namenode).

**Principal Performance Engineer, Oracle USA Inc.** *San Francisco, May 2011 - April 2014*
- Conducted root cause analysis for various performance issues (thread contention, High CPU consumption, STW GC pauses, etc.) for various technology stack including JRockit JVM, Hotspot, Coherence cache, and Berkeley DB data store.

**Senior Performance Engineer, SuccessFactors.com** *May 2008 - May 2010*

**Senior Member of Technical Staff, Oracle Corp** *April 2001 - December 2008*
